Hi Joshua,

Just want to make sure this is correct. 

The reason I ask this question is, I was told by the testing facility I was not given the time back because of a decision from AWS’ support. 

This is why I’m reaching out here. 

The statement from the proctor at the time was ’Support was unable to verify the amount of time, so they didn’t give any.’ 

I challenge that, as, as I understand it, these are remote sessions. There should be logs of time from when I disconnected, and, at very least, a log of when the proctor logged back into the test from the other workstation. Taking the intangibles out of getting distracted and losing the focus and concentration, having to get back into the test-taking mindset, and secondarily subconsciously worrying about the clock not changing. 

If Pearson owns all the hardware and the systems the test runs on, I’m totally fine with pushing this further with them, but I don’t want to get into a back-and-forth between the three parties. 

I’d also not be pushing this if I had scored a 30%, but given I was LITERALLY 1 correct answer away from securing this certification, I have to lean on this. This test is notorious for not being able to be finished in the time given, and I was shorted my review time that I believe, and I think shows in what reviewed questions I did correct, would have made the difference. 

Who controls the decision and the mechanisms of giving time back when a hardware failure occurs? How do we get all of us in the same conversation?

Hi Joshua,

Thank you for the quick reply!

Just so I’m crystal clear in my understanding: you’re saying no one reached out to you during my test and requested more time be added, and you (AWS Support) never said ’No?’ You’re saying there’s no information concerning my exam at all regarding any interruption? 

Is that the correct interpretation of this?

Can you tell me what the process would be in this situation? Are you unable to, or what am I missing? 

What’s the process to appeal/start an investigation into something like this? I would expect you would have visibility into the disconnect and reconnect to the testing session from another workstation? I would expect you could see where I was on the test during that interruption and recognize that I didn’t interact with the test during that time?

I’ve got a separate communication started with PearsonVUE, but I’m also asking for assistance with the test and the results with AWS. ESPECIALLY if you’re saying you have ‘no information or notes related to the issue during the exam.’ 

If that’s the case, I was outright lied to, and I was shorted approximately 10 minutes time on a test that was designed to make every minute count. I was told ‘AWS Support’ was contacted and said ‘no.’ I am asking for your help to remediate this. 

What do I need to do from here?

Hello Grioghar,

Sorry for the misunderstanding,

We do have information related to the exam SAP-C02 / AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Professional you completed on Dec 29, 2022. What I meant was that there is no information noted related to your request for more time to be added during the exam. In order to continue with the appeal first we will need you to create a case directly with the exam delivery partner. Once created the situation should be cleared by the delivery partner.

Once the case is issued, depending on the resolution if you still need assistance please provide me with the ticket or case number you received. For additional inquiries, please submit a new case using this link:

Thanks, Josh.

To put a bow on this, and I promise to leave you be until I get a response back from PearsonVUE:

So you’re saying you were never contacted (or have no notes) about adding time? I have to imagine you have an audit trail of who accesses an account internally, but I won’t ask you to divulge it so much as simply say I’m curious about the possibility of a call coming in and not being logged. 

And to be clear, there’s no one at PearsonVUE who could add time? They have to reach out to AWS Support, correct? There’s no means for anyone in PearsonVUE to add time that the proctor might have reached out to? 

I’m trying to understand the process involved so I’m empowered in the conversation with PearsonVUE. 

What can you tell me?
